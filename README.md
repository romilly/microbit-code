# Microbit Code

This is the code repository for my forthcoming book of BBC micro:bit MicroPython projects. 

The book will be published by No Starch Press next year.

I'll be adding existing code over the next few days, and I'll also add very brief descriptions of each project as I
add the code. The descriptions are in the docs folder.

Most of the code is for the micro:bit,
though some of the projects also contain code that runs on a PC, Raspberry Pi or Laptop.

There will be a lot more detail in the book!

The book grew out of a workshop I ran at Raspberry Pi Towers a couple of years ago.

The original workbook for that workshop is freely available, and I have uploaded a copy
[here](docs/microbitmicropython.pdf).

It is also
[available on the web](https://www.rareschool.com/workshops/microbitmicropython.pdf).

There's a [support group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/microbit60mins/).

The workbook and the full book use the [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/) which is great for beginners coding in Python,
on the micro:bit, Adafruit boards or a Pi or other computer.
